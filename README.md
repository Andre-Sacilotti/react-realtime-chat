# React Realtime Chat (Front-end)

This is a frontend part of the a personal project. The ideia here is to implement a realtime chat with RabbitMQ,
create an authentication without any libraries and explore more about ui/ux design.

## Color Palette

I used as primary color #4F5E7B, then, changed lightness to 10% and 98% to get background and text color.
